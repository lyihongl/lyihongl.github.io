Hello! My name is Yi Hong Liu. I'm currently in my final year of Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.
I am interested in solving complex problems, and currently wish to become more proficient with C++.
I've done a number of internships during my time in uni, and went on foreign exchange to Taiwan, which is a very beautiful place.
I started doing Judo in Taiwan and fell in love with the sport, and try to train regularly. My goal is to get my blackbelt within
the next 3-4 years.
